Wow, just got out of Another Simple Favor and... oh boy, my head’s still spinning like a washing machine on a sugar rush. I think I still smell like theater popcorn, those crumbs are like, everywhere, man. My back hurts from those crappy seats. Why don’t cinemas think about people's lumbar support? Honestly, feels like I’m carrying a backpack full of bricks right now.

Okay okay, so remember when they were like at that wild cocktail party? That scene was nuts, right? The way they just flipped the script suddenly. And that dress! Looked like a mix of a phoenix and a disco ball, I swear. Totally gonna look for a knock-off 𝘰𝘯𝘭𝘪𝘯𝘦 later. Geez, I’m getting carried away.

> Was it just me or did the plot twist kinda feel like accidentally hitting shuffle on a Spotify playlist in the middle of a banger song? Unexpected explosions of drama everywhere! One second it’s calm, and then BAM! Hahaha, reminds me of that time we tried baking cookies and ended up with a minor kitchen fire. Good times.

I think someone asked me if they should 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   — honestly, maybe 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   first. Might be one of those that’s better on the big screen? The lady next to me was crunching on nachos real loud though, couldn’t hear a few lines, but those visuals were something. Something out of a neon-lit fever dream.

Then there was that chase scene down the alley, which got my heart thumping like a frenzied squirrel at an acorn rave. The soundtrack there! Kinda wanna 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 that. Made everything feel larger than life, like fast-forwarding through a Monday morning.

And the dialogue, oh man, it was like they took pages from a detective novel and splatted them on some jet-fueled sitcom. Not entirely sure where one thread ended and the other began, but that’s probably just me being me. Haha, my mind’s like a pinball sometimes.

Oh snap, gotta mention the final scene, which, wow, was equal parts holy sht and really?” No spoilers though. But let’s just say, it’s like when you think you’ve nailed a jump in a video game but then end up falling into a hidden level.

```c
#include <confusion.h>
int main() {
    printf(Wait, what?);
    return unexpected_twists;
}
```

Anyway, lemme know what you think if you catch it. Or, uh, don't? Whatever floats your boat, pal!
